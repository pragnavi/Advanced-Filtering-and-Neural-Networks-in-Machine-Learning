# Enhancing Machine Learning Models with Advanced Filtering Techniques and Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This final project delves into the application of item-based and user-based filtering techniques alongside neural network models to enhance machine learning predictions. Spanning across two main parts (A and B), it offers a comprehensive analysis, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, showcasing the impact of these methodologies on model accuracy.

## Directory Structure
- `part_a` and `part_b`: Contain the project's segmented analyses and experiments.
- `data`: Includes datasets utilized throughout the project for training and testing purposes.
- `utils.py`: Offers utility functions supporting data manipulation and analysis workflows.
- `majority_vote.py`: Implements a specific algorithmic approach, potentially for aggregating predictions or insights.

## Key Findings
- Visualizations (`ValAcc_vs_K_Item_based_Filtering.png` and `ValAcc_vs_K_User_based_Filtering.png`) illustrate the comparative analysis of filtering techniques.
- `neural_network.png`: Depicts the architecture of the neural network model developed as part of the project's innovative solutions.

## Getting Started
To replicate or extend our findings:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the datasets within the `data` directory and run the Python scripts to understand the preprocessing and modeling steps.
